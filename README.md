# CSC680
Final Project for CSC680 (Mobile App Dev)

My name is Deven Young, and I had a bunch of ideas for this class, such as stratego, connect 4x4, and a bunch of other games. However, after trying to implement these one by one, I realized how unrealistic this was. In the end, I decided upon a "Check in" app which essentially acts as a Calendar app. The app is connected to a firebase database, which stores user information as well as event information. 

Must have features:
  - Users should be able to create accounts
  - Users should be able to log in with verified credentials
  - Users should be able to create events
  - Users should be able to delete events from their dashboard
  - Users should be able to invite others to join their events
  - Users should be able to have friends (other users)
  - Events should be displayed in a nice manner on the screen

Nice to have features:
  - Users can "check in" to events to tell others they will be attending
  - Push notifications to remind users of an event
  - Events could be recurring
